31b07ceea9316fb8b2945e8c409a18639125a9d1,DiscoPG: Property Graph Schema Discovery and Exploration,"  Property graphs are becoming pervasive in a variety of graph processing applications using interconnected data. They allow to encode multi-labeled nodes and edges, as well as their properties, represented as key/value pairs. Although property graphs are widely used in several open-source and commercial graph databases, they lack a schema definition, unlike their relational counterparts. The property graph schema discovery problem consists of extracting the underlying schema concepts and types from such graph datasets. We showcase DiscoPG, a system for efficiently and accurately discovering and exploring property graph schemas. To this end, it leverages hierarchical clustering using a Gaussian Mixture Model, which accounts for both node labels and properties. DiscoPG allows users to perform schema discovery for both static and dynamic graph datasets. Suitable visualization layouts and dedicated dashboards enable the user perception of the static and dynamic inferred schema on the node clusters, as well as the differences in runtimes and clustering quality. To the best of our knowledge, DiscoPG is the  first system to tackle the property graph schema discovery problem.  As such, it supports the insightful exploration of the graph schema components and their evolving behavior, while revealing the underpinnings of the clustering-based discovery process.

a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84,Who Controls the Internet?: Analyzing Global Threats using Property Graph Traversals,"The Internet is built on top of intertwined network services, e.g., email, DNS, and content distribution networks operated by private or governmental organizations. Recent events have shown that these organizations may, knowingly or unknowingly, be part of global-scale security incidents including state-sponsored mass surveillance programs and large-scale DDoS attacks. For example, in March 2015 the Great Cannon attack has shown that an Internet service provider can weaponize millions of Web browsers and turn them into DDoS bots by injecting malicious JavaScript code into transiting TCP connections. While attack techniques and root cause vulnerabilities are routinely studied, we still lack models and algorithms to study the intricate dependencies between services and providers, reason on their abuse, and assess the attack impact. To close this gap, we present a technique that models services, providers, and dependencies as a property graph. Moreover, we present a taint-style propagation-based technique to query the model, and present an evaluation of our framework on the top 100k Alexa domains.",2017,29,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Political Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",2017-04-03,"[{'paperId': 'd9b218b1a53a715cc9905304750e955b689d7c6b', 'title': 'Measurement and Analysis of Private Key Sharing in the HTTPS Ecosystem'}, {'paperId': '3ed41761416f6e6f1840de07f35c4059418e0cbb', 'title': 'Who Gets the Boot?

2742192c8d7248be8423e0333a9ab1c62c98bbbd,openCypher: New Directions in Property Graph Querying,"Cypher is a property graph query language that provides expressive and efficient querying of graph data. Originally designed and implemented within the Neo4j graph database, it is now being used by several industrial database products, as well as open-source and research projects. Since 2015, Cypher has been an open, evolving language, with the aim of becoming a fullyspecified standard with many independent implementations. We introduce Cypher and the property graph model, and then describe extensions – either actively being developed or under discussion – which will be incorporated into Cypher in the near future. These include (i) making Cypher into a fully compositional language by supporting multiple graphs and allowing graphs to be returned from queries; (ii) allowing for more complex patterns (based on regular path queries) to be expressed; and (iii) allowing for different pattern matching semantics – homomorphism, relationship isomorphism (the current default) or node isomorphism – to be configured at a query-by-query level. A subset of the proposed Cypher language extensions has already been implemented on top of Apache Spark. In the tutorial, wewill present our approach including an in-depth analysis of the challenges we faced. This includes mapping the property graph model to the Spark DataFrame abstraction and the translation of Cypher query operators into relational transformations. The tutorial will conclude with a demonstration based on a real-world graph analytical use case.",2018,12,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",,"[{'paperId': '4530a876508fce5603a32ec131892b02eb64c430', 'title': 'Model-Driven Engineering of an OpenCypher Engine: Using Graph Queries to Compile Graph Queries'}, {'paperId': '0cd7ba8905f4772afe58ec3dd698160678730f6c', 'title': 'Cypher-based Graph Pattern Matching in Gradoop'}, {'paperId': '30bf7d1694641f6bb3289d980a2326183ad560f0', 'title': 'Cytosm: Declarative Property Graph Queries Without Data Migration'}, {'paperId': '8100028a3ddf9b22d1e068cfa48f10106dab3db2', 'title': 'Formalising opencypher Graph Queries in Relational Algebra'}, {'paperId': 'dcbaf58b16ac7ef947879ea37c021466357b291a', 'title': 'Use of Graph Database for the Integration of Heterogeneous Biological Data'}, {'paperId': 'e3ce49f5bd82852ca143214faffa909ce13f0c97', 'title': 'Evaluating Twitter Influence Ranking with System Theory'}, {'paperId': '647d0e540627c5a903299a90d20530f8e48c18d9', 'title': 'Representing and querying disease networks using graph databases'}, {'paperId': 'acc1cd0a006eda579a22d039cd1679bd2a2abd45', 'title': 'An Integrated Data Driven Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Gene-Disease Associations'}, {'paperId': 'fa77a44f3f1857361a50c3137d623c35ef8a5739', 'title': 'Querying Graphs with Data'}, {'paperId': '82181d5c33590a81ab3b773c3948141eb22d89fb', 'title': 'Property Graph vs RDF Triple Store: A Comparison on Glycan Substructure Search'}, {'paperId': 'c5d60458d9fed3926d6f7a14b257063e44ae6399', 'title': 'Frappé: Querying the Linux Kernel Dependency Graph'}, {'paperId': 'd6adbafb07c7a5590516404208fe8776f1363eb3', 'title': 'GraphX: Graph Processing in a Distributed Dataflow Framework'}, {'paperId': 'f8fd581824c35b6072b11c6886384df200988e7d', 'title': 'Introduction to Graph Databases'}, {'paperId': '31f27864950a6c417cf996927b2d5558f70d2b14', 'title': 'GraphX: a resilient distributed graph system on Spark'}, {'paperId': '798cc254a94dc6f72896bcdc518a3447fbc94c3d', 'title': 'Resilient Distributed Datasets: A Fault-Tolerant Abstraction for In-Memory Cluster Computing'}, {'paperId': '846670cc06fd22e6b40748049b00a4479bd61446', 'title': 'A graphical query language supporting recursion'}, {'paperId': 'b3991046adb9264dd92ac2ea3115a4259bac1364', 'title': 'An Algebra and Equivalences to Transform Graph Patterns in Neo4j'}, {'paperId': 'ef9040b10adb1eb4c25f9b3fe646784bd5f86aa1', 'title': 'The Graph Story of the SAP HANA Database'}, {'paperId': '0ec2a62edef364f4bef1e1b265d3d7869bb4444a', 'title': 'Database Systems: The Complete Book'}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'Graph pattern matching semantics. https://tinyurl.com/ oCIM1-patternmatching'}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'How the ICIJ used Neo4j to unravel the Panama Papers'}]","Graph querying, Graph pattern matching, Graph algorithms, Graph-based recommendation, Graph visualization, Property Graph",conference,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,"49061836,2712246,2820923,31846192,2748632,2341999","Alastair Green,Martin Junghanns,Max Kießling,Tobias Lindaaker,Stefan Plantikow,P.
