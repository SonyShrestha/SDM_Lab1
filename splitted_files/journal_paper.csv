31b07ceea9316fb8b2945e8c409a18639125a9d1,DiscoPG: Property Graph Schema Discovery and Exploration,"  Property graphs are becoming pervasive in a variety of graph processing applications using interconnected data. They allow to encode multi-labeled nodes and edges, as well as their properties, represented as key/value pairs. Although property graphs are widely used in several open-source and commercial graph databases, they lack a schema definition, unlike their relational counterparts. The property graph schema discovery problem consists of extracting the underlying schema concepts and types from such graph datasets. We showcase DiscoPG, a system for efficiently and accurately discovering and exploring property graph schemas. To this end, it leverages hierarchical clustering using a Gaussian Mixture Model, which accounts for both node labels and properties. DiscoPG allows users to perform schema discovery for both static and dynamic graph datasets. Suitable visualization layouts and dedicated dashboards enable the user perception of the static and dynamic inferred schema on the node clusters, as well as the differences in runtimes and clustering quality. To the best of our knowledge, DiscoPG is the  first system to tackle the property graph schema discovery problem.  As such, it supports the insightful exploration of the graph schema components and their evolving behavior, while revealing the underpinnings of the clustering-based discovery process.

2d95c27d4ed8cfb8379164888cd79c6b239250b4,Mapping RDF Databases to Property Graph Databases,"RDF triplestores and property graph databases are two approaches for data management which are based on modeling, storing and querying graph-like data. In spite of such common principle, they present special features that complicate the task of database interoperability. While there exist some methods to transform RDF graphs into property graphs, and vice versa, they lack compatibility and a solid formal foundation. This paper presents three direct mappings (schema-dependent and schema-independent) for transforming an RDF database into a property graph database, including data and schema. We show that two of the proposed mappings satisfy the properties of semantics preservation and information preservation. The existence of both mappings allows us to conclude that the property graph data model subsumes the information capacity of the RDF data model.",2020,39,2020-05-07,"Graph representation learning, Graph pattern matching, Graph indexing, Graph clustering, Graph embeddings, Property Graph",IEEE Access,"2772109,144245703,1777646","Renzo Angles,Harsh Thakkar,Dominik Tomaszuk",2772109,"0ff76855604fc150ecd36bc8c3197780a8ea2b23,501b6c76007e700e1b82f34930d24fc04709fc9d,39af4070dca3221d275898c55884167bc03fe73d,42fe18be6e9ff2c11e5b2347c93e131c9abc7a51,b31ce19f12bbf6058f4fe849d9f3654932353f20,61aec24ce3ce839bf08ce98e061099f2a20a50d6,8f7a7aea33c942e626832f014a831361b7fa39c7,db9967871249ffd77adc0c0cc16154ccc37d09ad,69381b5efd97e7c55f51c2730caccab3d632d4d2,5ccd1eefd94af0a20e10a0a5e0da22aa2f481c76,122a535ae02d4e0fa2512f9c3be77eae6a007266,dba7c73503c4b7abad96aaa4a167fd7e701c4059,91d6e8ba5dd90b02fe3bd870b19da13a6167af53,8640a08cdb759d52da026f6d89521e36c61b5910,63dc64fc2d23be98100f4c59e82278d838c78ef9,6289d1271ff8176888d971bd8468dc5495b533f0,07c4549be429a52274bc0ec083bf5598a3e5c365,59f1df2f60280eea79d195b9c561d52a77fb24de,d9f836a2062864e4808e12224e2286a353498202,bfdc1a7d5aab0f4bce4afc9723192937c24ef5ff,47bca586abefde3b796b65c986269f082fcb59c5,b8aecf918f1c729eb2a2fa88da9eb16835daca5a,873b045dea18c2092b2c11e7b9542dd93ce84d65,0fbe5e2f2e2b8e2b2e2f0013e2e07cac2e5ce926,1f9058eb0b639d0dffae192b3ffd5d80adabf0e9,a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84,28816b148281af9ba41469b4c69dd69c2afd2b95,a4c5339f3f31c4a4406a1d82d3b0f3c63386166e,be88a24e9b6e26f10d4d84183c8f05ba33eb60c0,a91e67f6b72a3bb9b5f0f054a252c8ee0cbfd898,2742192c8d7248be8423e0333a9ab1c62c98bbbd,bcad76ae5cea05bad85fd6b2b08aa30a801d9a3b,07627bf7eb649220ffbcdf6bf233e3a4a76e8590,689c7a86d973895a14feb984b8faa3d5581038ef,ce8a567f7578e8b6c9dc6510e2b058bd3a02019c,8cfb3412f1bd6025e14f4665c5723ed60a5d8061,70f7cd54b5918aed60c3d8c3a8e4aa7e8d634c41,7c70459d56214a7a3202732670f5ce726508eff6,bc9fde639ceaceafe84c0ad94a2cd7badef141d3",8,"2227868312,3223911,147869186"

82181d5c33590a81ab3b773c3948141eb22d89fb,Property Graph vs RDF Triple Store: A Comparison on Glycan Substructure Search,"Resource description framework (RDF) and Property Graph databases are emerging technologies that are used for storing graph-structured data. We compare these technologies through a molecular biology use case: glycan substructure search. Glycans are branched tree-like molecules composed of building blocks linked together by chemical bonds. The molecular structure of a glycan can be encoded into a direct acyclic graph where each node represents a building block and each edge serves as a chemical linkage between two building blocks. In this context, Graph databases are possible software solutions for storing glycan structures and Graph query languages, such as SPARQL and Cypher, can be used to perform a substructure search. Glycan substructure searching is an important feature for querying structure and experimental glycan databases and retrieving biologically meaningful data. This applies for example to identifying a region of the glycan recognised by a glycan binding protein (GBP). In this study, 19,404 glycan structures were selected from GlycomeDB (www.glycome-db.org) and modelled for being stored into a RDF triple store and a Property Graph. We then performed two different sets of searches and compared the query response times and the results from both technologies to assess performance and accuracy. The two implementations produced the same results, but interestingly we noted a difference in the query response times. Qualitative measures such as portability were also used to define further criteria for choosing the technology adapted to solving glycan substructure search and other comparable issues.",2015,16,2015-12-14,"Graph mining, Graph neural networks, Graph representation learning, Property graph query languages, Graph database, Property Graph",PLoS ONE,"2593963,24447797,2201329,3349310,2114675478,2258235","Davide Alocci,Julien Mariethoz,Oliver Horlacher,Jerven T.

9c96a700a7abff857df936783f9e12a1ab38eee5,Graph convolutional neural networks with global attention for improved materials property prediction.,"The development of an efficient and powerful machine learning (ML) model for materials property prediction (MPP) remains an important challenge in materials science. While various techniques have been proposed to extract physicochemical features in MPP, graph neural networks (GNN) have also shown very strong capability in capturing effective features for high-performance MPP. Nevertheless, current GNN models do not effectively differentiate the contributions from different atoms. In this paper we develop a novel graph neural network model called GATGNN for predicting properties of inorganic materials. GATGNN is characterized by its composition of augmented graph-attention layers (AGAT) and a global attention layer. The application of AGAT layers and global attention layers respectively learn the local relationship among neighboring atoms and overall contribution of the atoms to the material's property; together making our framework achieve considerably better prediction performance on various tested properties. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method is able to outperform existing state-of-the-art GNN models while it can also provide a measurable insight into the correlation between the atoms and their material property.

873b045dea18c2092b2c11e7b9542dd93ce84d65,Molecule Property Prediction Based on Spatial Graph Embedding,"Accurate prediction of molecular properties is important for new compounds design, which is a crucial step in drug discovery. In this paper, molecular graph data is utilized for properties prediction based on graph convolution neural net-work. In addition, a Convolution Spatial Graph Embedding Layer (C-SGEL) is introduced to retain the spatial connection information of molecules. And multiple C-SGELs are stack to construct a Convolution Spatial Graph Embedding Network (C-SGEN) for end-to-end representation learning. In order to enhance the robustness of the network, molecular finger-prints are also combined with C-SGEN to build a composite model for predicting molecular properties.

e259ee075998eedc0b0c91c17769bf9dffeba46f,Graph Self-Supervised Learning: A Survey,"Deep learning on graphs has attracted significant interests recently. However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL), which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning paradigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer vision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph self-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a unified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL. According to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into four categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based, and hybrid approaches. We further describe the applications of graph SSL across various research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation benchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and potential future directions in this research field.",2021,6,2021-02-27,"Graph storage, Graph algorithms, Property graph schema, Graph partitioning, Graph analytics, Property Graph",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"2116018493,2585415,2072905592,1857210,2143633281,144019071","Yixin Liu,Shirui Pan,Ming Jin,Chuan Zhou,Feng Xia,Philip S.

0ff76855604fc150ecd36bc8c3197780a8ea2b23,Analyzing Learned Molecular Representations for Property Prediction,"Advancements in neural machinery have led to a wide range of algorithmic solutions for molecular property prediction. Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial data sets spanning a wide variety of chemical end points. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary data sets.

Here, we develop, for the first time, universal MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models for accurate property prediction in both molecules and crystals. We demonstrate that our MEGNet models significantly outperform prior ML models in 11 out of 13 properties of the QM9 molecule data set. Furthermore, a single-task unified MEGNet model can accurately predict the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy, with temperature, pressure and entropy being global state inputs. Similarly, we show that MEGNet models trained on $\sim 60,000$ crystals in the Materials Project substantially outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band gaps and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than DFT accuracy over a much larger data set. Such MEGNet models are highly interpretable, and well-established periodic chemical trends can be extracted from the elemental embeddings. Finally, we demonstrate the transfer learning of elemental embeddings from a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to accelerate the training of property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli)",2018,9,2018-12-12,"Graph algorithms, Graph embeddings, Graph visualization, Property graph schema, Graph mining, Property Graph",Chemistry of Materials,"143915066,15698847,11844524,102693597,2381325","Chi Chen,Weike Ye,Yunxing Zuo,Chen Zheng,S.

70f7cd54b5918aed60c3d8c3a8e4aa7e8d634c41,AliGraph: A Comprehensive Graph Neural Network Platform,"An increasing number of machine learning tasks require dealing with large graph datasets, which capture rich and complex relation- ship among potentially billions of elements. Graph Neural Network (GNN) becomes an effective way to address the graph learning problem by converting the graph data into a low dimensional space while keeping both the structural and property information to the maximum extent and constructing a neural network for training and referencing. However, it is challenging to provide an efficient graph storage and computation capabilities to facilitate GNN training and enable development of new GNN algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive graph neural network system, namely AliGraph, which consists of distributed graph storage, optimized sampling operators and runtime to efficiently support not only existing popular GNNs but also a series of in-house developed ones for different scenarios. The system is currently deployed at Alibaba to support a variety of business scenarios, including product recommendation and personalized search at Alibaba's E-Commerce platform. By conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with 492.90 million vertices, 6.82 billion edges and rich attributes, Ali- Graph performs an order of magnitude faster in terms of graph building (5 minutes vs hours reported from the state-of-the-art PowerGraph platform). At training, AliGraph runs 40%-50% faster with the novel caching strategy and demonstrates around 12 times speed up with the improved runtime. In addition, our in-house developed GNN models all showcase their statistically significant superiorities in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency (e.g., 4.12% 17.19% lift by F1 scores).",2019,43,2019-02-23,"Graph clustering, Graph database, Graph embeddings, Graph analytics, Graph mining, Property Graph",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,"2150059510,2115011449,38385080,71666838,144161025,10720938,1962987077,1709595","Rong Zhu,Kun Zhao,Hongxia Yang,Wei Lin,Chang Zhou,Baole Ai,Yong Li,Jingren Zhou",2150059510,"8cfb3412f1bd6025e14f4665c5723ed60a5d8061,cf4068a73d72ced9809a5e2462bb450bbbd47a64,82181d5c33590a81ab3b773c3948141eb22d89fb,59a268ee97ba83c04abbe02769bd61dcd3747d25,d9f836a2062864e4808e12224e2286a353498202,b15e942e526e4a03ecd0af31cbdf9b43bf81a829,7a62457a9942e45429d4b5d9d8370210df3875ec,7c70459d56214a7a3202732670f5ce726508eff6,6fa2d1873bc12d1a698ec8d0e5e32e4236f3bd2b,8640a08cdb759d52da026f6d89521e36c61b5910,fa9645e0491164fe78890073548284604958f383,0fbe5e2f2e2b8e2b2e2f0013e2e07cac2e5ce926,30bf7d1694641f6bb3289d980a2326183ad560f0,a4c5339f3f31c4a4406a1d82d3b0f3c63386166e,b8aecf918f1c729eb2a2fa88da9eb16835daca5a,07627bf7eb649220ffbcdf6bf233e3a4a76e8590,42fe18be6e9ff2c11e5b2347c93e131c9abc7a51,b31ce19f12bbf6058f4fe849d9f3654932353f20,1f9058eb0b639d0dffae192b3ffd5d80adabf0e9,d154d986c3a402c207c6c0e22093f2e1a878fe71,28816b148281af9ba41469b4c69dd69c2afd2b95,dba7c73503c4b7abad96aaa4a167fd7e701c4059,ce8a567f7578e8b6c9dc6510e2b058bd3a02019c,6998e4ae3f1e037128bc57a56dd5d7707098e6bf,91d6e8ba5dd90b02fe3bd870b19da13a6167af53,5ccd1eefd94af0a20e10a0a5e0da22aa2f481c76,8f7a7aea33c942e626832f014a831361b7fa39c7,a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84,32c1e0f9ef6f1e337fe4aa2a4907314e5a3f4a5b,be88a24e9b6e26f10d4d84183c8f05ba33eb60c0,f47def30face829e8034a292c2e3e7a9f4240d34,e3b9ffde49c9b4a57b09a651187a2e194cb35693,d71c0365685300539109e0fd07e34c9dd9beff75,d8b65198c37ada92cada81fe315508fc5bdbab8f,093e777e08d3a5474e225bbdb1a124d30434d416,122a535ae02d4e0fa2512f9c3be77eae6a007266,4d044f0c84be360b26398b58027e618d5f08a83f,7ad94b0ec31d38b7915e88f743b573edb8efce5b,db9967871249ffd77adc0c0cc16154ccc37d09ad,a91e67f6b72a3bb9b5f0f054a252c8ee0cbfd898,69381b5efd97e7c55f51c2730caccab3d632d4d2,2742192c8d7248be8423e0333a9ab1c62c98bbbd,59f1df2f60280eea79d195b9c561d52a77fb24de",,"2108844303,2005517418,2108194856"

69381b5efd97e7c55f51c2730caccab3d632d4d2,Graph Embedding and Extensions: A General Framework for Dimensionality Reduction,"A large family of algorithms - supervised or unsupervised; stemming from statistics or geometry theory - has been designed to provide different solutions to the problem of dimensionality reduction. Despite the different motivations of these algorithms, we present in this paper a general formulation known as graph embedding to unify them within a common framework. In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal Fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability. We show that MFA effectively overcomes the limitations of the traditional linear discriminant analysis algorithm due to data distribution assumptions and available projection directions. Real face recognition experiments show the superiority of our proposed MFA in comparison to LDA, also for corresponding kernel and tensor extensions",2007,7,2007-01-01,"Graph pattern matching, Graph clustering, Graph visualization, Graph representation learning, Graph neural networks, Property Graph",IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,"143653681,38188040,2158301,2144973386,152290618,145676588","Shuicheng Yan,Dong Xu,Benyu Zhang,HongJiang Zhang,Qiang Yang,Stephen Lin",143653681,"b31ce19f12bbf6058f4fe849d9f3654932353f20,7a62457a9942e45429d4b5d9d8370210df3875ec,db9967871249ffd77adc0c0cc16154ccc37d09ad,0fbe5e2f2e2b8e2b2e2f0013e2e07cac2e5ce926,ce8a567f7578e8b6c9dc6510e2b058bd3a02019c,e3b9ffde49c9b4a57b09a651187a2e194cb35693,5ccd1eefd94af0a20e10a0a5e0da22aa2f481c76",29,"1681148,1703204,47557631"
3cc9c49e2680eb8396d32e1390e2d384560f2dd4,Normalizing Property Graphs,"Normalization aims at minimizing sources of potential data inconsistency and costs of update maintenance incurred by data redundancy. For relational databases, different classes of dependencies cause data redundancy and have resulted in proposals such as Third, Boyce-Codd, Fourth and Fifth Normal Form. Features of more advanced data models make it challenging to extend achievements from the relational model to missing, non-atomic, or uncertain data. We initiate research on the normalization of graph data, starting with a class of functional dependencies tailored to property graphs. We show that this class captures important semantics of applications, constitutes a rich source of data redundancy, its implication problem can be decided in linear time, and facilitates the normalization of property graphs flexibly tailored to their labels and properties that are targeted by applications. We normalize property graphs into Boyce-Codd Normal Form without loss of data and dependencies whenever possible for the target labels and properties, but guarantee Third Normal Form in general. Experiments on real-world property graphs quantify and qualify various benefits of graph normalization: 1) removing redundant property values as sources of inconsistent data, 2) detecting inconsistency as violation of functional dependencies, 3) reducing update overheads by orders of magnitude, and 4) significant speed ups of aggregate queries.",2023,1,2023-07-01,"Graph neural networks, Graph mining, Graph storage, Property graph schema, Graph-based recommendation, Property Graph",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,"2114957681,2288285","Philipp Skavantzos,S.

These methods ignore the correlation of graph structure among multiple views and clustering results highly depend on the quality of predefined affinity graphs. We address the problem of multiview clustering by seamlessly integrating graph structures of different views to fully exploit the geometric property of underlying data structure. The proposed method is based on the assumption that the intrinsic underlying graph structure would assign corresponding connected component in each graph to the same cluster. Different graphs from multiple views are integrated by using the Hadamard product since different views usually together admit the same underlying structure across multiple views. Specifically, these graphs are integrated into a global one and the structure of the global graph is adaptively tuned by a well-designed objective function so that the number of components of the graph is exactly equal to the number of clusters. It is worth noting that we directly obtain cluster indicators from the graph itself without performing further graph-cut or $k$k-means clustering algorithms. Experiments show the proposed method obtains better clustering performance than the state-of-the-art methods.",2019,11,2019-10-01,"Property graph schema, Graph-based recommendation, Property graph query languages, Graph visualization, Graph embeddings, Property Graph",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"1918754,79690137,80042659,144962210,144704038,2143684775","K.

Thereafter, we discuss navigational expressions, in which patterns can be matched recursively against the graph to navigate paths of arbitrary length; we give an overview of what kinds of expressions have been proposed and how they can be combined with graph patterns. We also discuss several semantics under which queries using the previous features can be evaluated, what effects the selection of features and semantics has on complexity, and offer examples of such features in three modern languages that are used to query graphs: SPARQL, Cypher, and Gremlin. We conclude by discussing the importance of formalisation for graph query languages; a summary of what is known about SPARQL, Cypher, and Gremlin in terms of expressivity and complexity; and an outline of possible future directions for the area.",2016,22,2016-10-20,"Graph querying, Graph database, Graph representation learning, Graph algorithms, Graph modeling, Property Graph",ACM Computing Surveys,"2772109,144658846,35106192,144007515,2478931,2434366","Renzo Angles,M.

The key parameters range from solubility (angstroms) to protein–ligand binding (nanometers) to in vivo toxicity (meters). Through feature learning—instead of feature engineering—deep neural networks promise to outperform both traditional physics-based and knowledge-based machine learning models for predicting molecular properties pertinent to drug discovery. To this end, we present the PotentialNet family of graph convolutions. These models are specifically designed for and achieve state-of-the-art performance for protein–ligand binding affinity. We further validate these deep neural networks by setting new standards of performance in several ligand-based tasks. In parallel, we introduce a new metric, the Regression Enrichment Factor EFχ(R), to measure the early enrichment of computational models for chemical data. Finally, we introduce a cross-validation strategy based on structural homology clustering that can more accurately measure model generalizability, which crucially distinguishes the aims of machine learning for drug discovery from standard machine learning tasks.",2018,24,2018-03-12,"Graph mining, Graph querying, Graph-based recommendation, Graph analytics, Property graph schema, Property Graph",ACS Central Science,"5932099,39460558,9957625,8751433,80646261,2154902070,51248807,49500220,2378027,1806271","Evan N.

Traditional approaches rely on group additivity rules, empirical measurements or parameters, or generation of thousands of descriptors. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network for this embedding task by treating molecules as undirected graphs with attributed nodes and edges. Simple atom and bond attributes are used to construct atom-specific feature vectors that take into account the local chemical environment using different neighborhood radii. By working directly with the full molecular graph, there is a greater opportunity for models to identify important features relevant to a prediction task. Unlike other graph-based approaches, our atom featurization preserves molecule-level spatial information that significantly enhances model performance. Our models learn to identify important features of atom clusters for the prediction of aqueous solubility, octanol solubility, melting point, and toxicity.

b8aecf918f1c729eb2a2fa88da9eb16835daca5a,Learning Laplacian Matrix in Smooth Graph Signal Representations,"The construction of a meaningful graph plays a crucial role in the success of many graph-based representations and algorithms for handling structured data, especially in the emerging field of graph signal processing. However, a meaningful graph is not always readily available from the data, nor easy to define depending on the application domain. In particular, it is often desirable in graph signal processing applications that a graph is chosen such that the data admit certain regularity or smoothness on the graph. In this paper, we address the problem of learning graph Laplacians, which is equivalent to learning graph topologies, such that the input data form graph signals with smooth variations on the resulting topology. To this end, we adopt a factor analysis model for the graph signals and impose a Gaussian probabilistic prior on the latent variables that control these signals. We show that the Gaussian prior leads to an efficient representation that favors the smoothness property of the graph signals. We then propose an algorithm for learning graphs that enforces such property and is based on minimizing the variations of the signals on the learned graph. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data demonstrate that the proposed graph learning framework can efficiently infer meaningful graph topologies from signal observations under the smoothness prior.",2014,10,2014-06-30,"Graph partitioning, Graph neural networks, Graph database, Graph pattern matching, Property graph schema, Property Graph",IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,"145392527,3333045,1703189,1697397","Xiaowen Dong,D.

7ad94b0ec31d38b7915e88f743b573edb8efce5b,Stationary Graph Processes and Spectral Estimation,"Stationarity is a cornerstone property that facilitates the analysis and processing of random signals in the time domain. Although time-varying signals are abundant in nature, in many practical scenarios, the information of interest resides in more irregular graph domains. This lack of regularity hampers the generalization of the classical notion of stationarity to graph signals. This paper proposes a definition of weak stationarity for random graph signals that takes into account the structure of the graph where the random process takes place, while inheriting many of the meaningful properties of the classical time domain definition. Provided that the topology of the graph can be described by a normal matrix, stationary graph processes can be modeled as the output of a linear graph filter applied to a white input. This is shown equivalent to requiring the correlation matrix to be diagonalized by the graph Fourier transform; a fact that is leveraged to define a notion of power spectral density (PSD). Properties of the graph PSD are analyzed and a number of methods for its estimation are proposed. This includes generalizations of nonparametric approaches such as periodograms, window-based average periodograms, and filter banks, as well as parametric approaches, using moving-average, autoregressive, and ARMA processes. Graph stationarity and graph PSD estimation are investigated numerically for synthetic and real-world graph signals.",2016,13,2016-03-14,"Graph analytics, Graph mining, Property graph query languages, Graph visualization, Property graph schema, Property Graph",IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,"145135725,2262891,143668698,144461639","A.

30acd43e62dbbdbe823bcc321ca1a1660ec7a622,PGO: Describing Property Graphs in RDF,"RDF and Property Graphs are data models that are being used to represent Knowledge Graphs. The definition of methods to transform RDF data into Property graph data is fundamental to allow interoperability among the systems using these models. Although both models are based on a graph structure, they have special features that complicate the definition of data transformation methods. This article presents an ontology-based approach to transform (automatically) property graphs into RDF graphs. The ontology, called PGO, defines a set of terms that allows describing the elements of a property graph. The algorithm corresponding to the transformation method is described, and some properties of the method are discussed (complexity, data preservation, and monotonicity). The results of an experimental evaluation are also presented.",2020,10,2020-06-12,"Graph partitioning, Graph embeddings, Property graph schema, Graph modeling, Graph similarity, Property Graph",IEEE Access,"1777646,2772109,144245703","Dominik Tomaszuk,Renzo Angles,Harsh Thakkar",1777646,"093e777e08d3a5474e225bbdb1a124d30434d416,501b6c76007e700e1b82f34930d24fc04709fc9d,be88a24e9b6e26f10d4d84183c8f05ba33eb60c0,7a62457a9942e45429d4b5d9d8370210df3875ec,d8b65198c37ada92cada81fe315508fc5bdbab8f,122a535ae02d4e0fa2512f9c3be77eae6a007266,4d044f0c84be360b26398b58027e618d5f08a83f,8f7a7aea33c942e626832f014a831361b7fa39c7,6fa2d1873bc12d1a698ec8d0e5e32e4236f3bd2b,bcad76ae5cea05bad85fd6b2b08aa30a801d9a3b",8,"143824804,144704038,2145408511"
