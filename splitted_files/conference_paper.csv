a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84,Who Controls the Internet?: Analyzing Global Threats using Property Graph Traversals,"The Internet is built on top of intertwined network services, e.g., email, DNS, and content distribution networks operated by private or governmental organizations. Recent events have shown that these organizations may, knowingly or unknowingly, be part of global-scale security incidents including state-sponsored mass surveillance programs and large-scale DDoS attacks. For example, in March 2015 the Great Cannon attack has shown that an Internet service provider can weaponize millions of Web browsers and turn them into DDoS bots by injecting malicious JavaScript code into transiting TCP connections. While attack techniques and root cause vulnerabilities are routinely studied, we still lack models and algorithms to study the intricate dependencies between services and providers, reason on their abuse, and assess the attack impact. To close this gap, we present a technique that models services, providers, and dependencies as a property graph. Moreover, we present a taint-style propagation-based technique to query the model, and present an evaluation of our framework on the top 100k Alexa domains.",2017,29,2017-04-03,"Graph modeling, Graph-based recommendation, Graph indexing, Graph representation learning, Property graph query languages, Property Graph",The Web Conference,"2967882,35030227,1701081,144588806","Milivoj Simeonovski,Giancarlo Pellegrino,C.

2742192c8d7248be8423e0333a9ab1c62c98bbbd,openCypher: New Directions in Property Graph Querying,"Cypher is a property graph query language that provides expressive and efficient querying of graph data. Originally designed and implemented within the Neo4j graph database, it is now being used by several industrial database products, as well as open-source and research projects. Since 2015, Cypher has been an open, evolving language, with the aim of becoming a fullyspecified standard with many independent implementations. We introduce Cypher and the property graph model, and then describe extensions – either actively being developed or under discussion – which will be incorporated into Cypher in the near future. These include (i) making Cypher into a fully compositional language by supporting multiple graphs and allowing graphs to be returned from queries; (ii) allowing for more complex patterns (based on regular path queries) to be expressed; and (iii) allowing for different pattern matching semantics – homomorphism, relationship isomorphism (the current default) or node isomorphism – to be configured at a query-by-query level. A subset of the proposed Cypher language extensions has already been implemented on top of Apache Spark. In the tutorial, wewill present our approach including an in-depth analysis of the challenges we faced. This includes mapping the property graph model to the Spark DataFrame abstraction and the translation of Cypher query operators into relational transformations. The tutorial will conclude with a demonstration based on a real-world graph analytical use case.",2018,12,,"Graph querying, Graph pattern matching, Graph algorithms, Graph-based recommendation, Graph visualization, Property Graph",International Conference on Extending Database Technology,"49061836,2712246,2820923,31846192,2748632,2341999","Alastair Green,Martin Junghanns,Max Kießling,Tobias Lindaaker,Stefan Plantikow,P.
