2ac3791b6a89763c509976d1f876eecc00e64fd5,DuckPGQ: Efficient Property Graph Queries in an analytical RDBMS,"In the past decade, property graph databases have emerged as a growing niche in data management. Many native graph systems and query languages have been created, but the functionality and performance still leave much room for improvement. The upcoming SQL:2023 will introduce the Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ) sub-language, giving relational systems the opportunity to standard-ize graph queries, and provide mature graph query functionality. We argue that (i) competent graph data systems must build on all technology that makes up a state-of-the-art relational system, (ii) the graph use case requires the addition to that of a many-source/destination path-finding algorithm and compact graph rep-resentation, and (iii) incites research in practical worst-case-optimal joins and factorized query processing techniques. We outline our design of DuckPGQ that follows this recipe, by adding efficient SQL/PGQ support to the popular open-source “embeddable analytics” relational database system DuckDB, also originally developed at CWI. Our design aims at minimizing techni-cal debt using an approach that relies on efficient vectorized UDFs. We benchmark DuckPGQ showing encouraging performance and scalability on large graph data sets, but also reinforcing the need for future research under (iii).",2023,10,2023-01-01,"Graph similarity, Graph algorithms, Graph clustering, Graph querying, Graph partitioning, Property Graph",Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research,"2219955175,2170409878,3254764,1687211","Daniel ten Wolde,Tavneet Singh,Gábor Szárnyas,P.

388423474f9fd71de70c9328ca48caa26277b50f,Hierarchical Clustering for Property Graph Schema Discovery,"The property graph model is becoming increasingly popular among users and is currently employed by several open-source and commercial graph database systems. Although property graphs are widely adopted, there is a lack of understanding of their underlying schema structure. In particular, the schema discovery problem consists of extracting the schema concepts from a property graph. A property graph schema helps build a concise description of the data it represents, to make it more digestible for humans and interactive processes, as well as usable for query optimization purposes. In this paper, we address the property graph schema discovery problem and introduce the GMMSchema method based on hierarchical clustering using a Gaussian Mixture Model, which accounts for both label and property information on nodes. We experimentally analyze the accuracy and performance of GMMSchema, compared to those of its closest competitor, and showcase its superiority on several commonly used datasets, including real-world ones, such as the Covid19 knowledge graph, as well as the Fib25 and Mb6 NeuPrint graphs.",2022,4,2022-01-01,"Graph database, Graph algorithms, Graph pattern matching, Graph analytics, Graph querying, Property Graph",International Conference on Extending Database Technology,"1699192,31359282,2161651957","A.

79d77cf59739fbf09f48b421f84fd5ea65d743c6,Vu1SPG: Vulnerability detection based on slice property graph representation learning,"Vulnerability detection is an important issue in software security. Although various data-driven vulnerability detection methods have been proposed, the task remains challenging since the diversity and complexity of real-world vulnerable code in syntax and semantics make it difficult to extract vulnerable features with regular deep learning models, especially in analyzing a large program. Moreover, the fact that real-world vulnerable codes contain a lot of redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities will further aggravate the above problem. To mitigate such challenges, we define a novel code representation named Slice Property Graph (SPG), and then propose VulSPG, a new vulnerability detection approach using the improved R-GCN model with triple attention mechanism to identify potential vulnerabilities in SPG. Our approach has at least two advantages over other methods. First, our proposed SPG can reflect the rich semantics and explicit structural information that may be relevance to vulnerabilities, while eliminating as much irrelevant information as possible to reduce the complexity of graph. Second, VulSPG incorporates triple attention mechanism in R-GCNs to achieve more effective learning of vulnerability patterns from SPG. We have extensively evaluated VulSPG on two large-scale datasets with programs from SARD and real-world projects. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of VulSPG.",2021,10,2021-09-06,"Graph algorithms, Graph database, Graph mining, Graph partitioning, Graph indexing, Property Graph",IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering,"1443742662,2117807802,2146501046","Weining Zheng,Yuan Jiang,Xiaohong Su",1443742662,"d154d986c3a402c207c6c0e22093f2e1a878fe71,ae365c85a23f422300b89ef646bf6b04f2edb94e,a11a7c37cc8f958ab9f16c7b8a0722ff5177b4d4,63dc64fc2d23be98100f4c59e82278d838c78ef9,6351590cf37eef826b89383fd8ccf8f1ab276559,1f9058eb0b639d0dffae192b3ffd5d80adabf0e9,d9f836a2062864e4808e12224e2286a353498202,873b045dea18c2092b2c11e7b9542dd93ce84d65,a2e52a7e9c0862d2d841e5a788f1e975e736d7c5,db9967871249ffd77adc0c0cc16154ccc37d09ad",21,"2285233261,2919642,47648651"

The CloudPG is able to resolve data flows between cloud applications deployed on different resources, and contextualizes the graph with runtime information, such as encryption settings. To provide a vendorand technology-independent representation of a cloud service's security posture, the graph is based on an ontology of cloud resources, their functionalities and security features. We show, using an example, that our CloudPG framework can be used by security experts to identify weaknesses in their cloud deployments, spanning multiple vendors or technologies, such as AWS, Azure and Kubernetes.

47bca586abefde3b796b65c986269f082fcb59c5,Property Graph Schema Optimization for Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs,"Enterprises are creating domain-specific knowledge graphs by curating and integrating their business data from multiple sources. Ontologies provide a semantic abstraction for such knowledge graphs to describe their data in terms of the entities involved and their relationships. There has been a lot of effort to build systems that enable efficient querying over knowledge graphs, represented as property graphs. However the problem of schema optimization in the property graph setting has been largely ignored. In this work, we show that graph schema design has significant impact on query performance, and propose two algorithms to generate an optimized property graph schema from the domain ontology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present an ontology-driven approach for property graph schema optimization. The rich semantic relationships in an ontology contain a variety of opportunities to reduce edge traversals and consequently improve the graph query performance. Our experimental study with two real-world knowledge graphs shows that our algorithms produce high-quality schemas, achieving up to 2 orders of magnitude speed-up compared to alternative schema designs.",2020,8,2020-03-25,"Graph pattern matching, Property graph schema, Graph visualization, Graph storage, Graph querying, Property Graph",IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering,"40536846,147869186,1949818,3226264,143972996","Chuan Lei,R.

8640a08cdb759d52da026f6d89521e36c61b5910,CPGVA: Code Property Graph based Vulnerability Analysis by Deep Learning,"The vast majority of security breaches encountered recent years are direct result of insecure source code. Therefore, the protection of software critically depends on the identification of security defect in source cod. The development and progress of relative technologies depend on the analysts' understanding of the safety issues and the accumulation of long-term experience, which provides a technical basis for the development of vulnerability analysis, but difficult to meet the growing demand of the code security industry. With the maturity of big data technology, the development of natural language processing, deep learning and data mining technology provided new ideas for vulnerability analysis. This paper exploited deep learning methods to review source code on basis of code property graph. We implemented our approach on public datasets Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD) of C/C++ command injection and compared with current popular methods, which proved that the proposed code property graph based vulnerability analysis by deep learning (CPGVA) method outper-formed the state of art deep learning source code defect analysis method with the improvement of about 4.5%, 4.2%, 1.7%, 7.9%, 8.1% respectively in femeasure, precision, false positive rate, true positive rate and false negative rate.",2018,28,2018-08-01,"Property graph query languages, Graph-based recommendation, Graph visualization, Graph database, Graph querying, Property Graph",International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology,"2108684717,2285618955,2288582453,2055760745,2285233261","Xiaomeng Wang,Tao Zhang,Runpu Wu,Wei Xin,Changyu Hou",2108684717,"093e777e08d3a5474e225bbdb1a124d30434d416,be88a24e9b6e26f10d4d84183c8f05ba33eb60c0,d154d986c3a402c207c6c0e22093f2e1a878fe71,59f1df2f60280eea79d195b9c561d52a77fb24de,8f7a7aea33c942e626832f014a831361b7fa39c7,7c70459d56214a7a3202732670f5ce726508eff6,07627bf7eb649220ffbcdf6bf233e3a4a76e8590,32c1e0f9ef6f1e337fe4aa2a4907314e5a3f4a5b,d9f836a2062864e4808e12224e2286a353498202,a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84,6fa2d1873bc12d1a698ec8d0e5e32e4236f3bd2b,b31ce19f12bbf6058f4fe849d9f3654932353f20,09430c7080172d50a591cef44d85fd16e58d945e,6998e4ae3f1e037128bc57a56dd5d7707098e6bf,28816b148281af9ba41469b4c69dd69c2afd2b95,07c4549be429a52274bc0ec083bf5598a3e5c365,1c2de5fc71be2be3af28545e873605ead4d7d79b,4d044f0c84be360b26398b58027e618d5f08a83f,b15e942e526e4a03ecd0af31cbdf9b43bf81a829,91d6e8ba5dd90b02fe3bd870b19da13a6167af53,dba7c73503c4b7abad96aaa4a167fd7e701c4059,8cfb3412f1bd6025e14f4665c5723ed60a5d8061,30bf7d1694641f6bb3289d980a2326183ad560f0,fa9645e0491164fe78890073548284604958f383,5ccd1eefd94af0a20e10a0a5e0da22aa2f481c76,cf4068a73d72ced9809a5e2462bb450bbbd47a64,7ad94b0ec31d38b7915e88f743b573edb8efce5b,0fbe5e2f2e2b8e2b2e2f0013e2e07cac2e5ce926",18,"79405068,2121692012,3685940"

Recent events have shown that these organizations may, knowingly or unknowingly, be part of global-scale security incidents including state-sponsored mass surveillance programs and large-scale DDoS attacks. For example, in March 2015 the Great Cannon attack has shown that an Internet service provider can weaponize millions of Web browsers and turn them into DDoS bots by injecting malicious JavaScript code into transiting TCP connections. While attack techniques and root cause vulnerabilities are routinely studied, we still lack models and algorithms to study the intricate dependencies between services and providers, reason on their abuse, and assess the attack impact.

Originally designed and implemented within the Neo4j graph database, it is now being used by several industrial database products, as well as open-source and research projects. Since 2015, Cypher has been an open, evolving language, with the aim of becoming a fullyspecified standard with many independent implementations. We introduce Cypher and the property graph model, and then describe extensions – either actively being developed or under discussion – which will be incorporated into Cypher in the near future. These include (i) making Cypher into a fully compositional language by supporting multiple graphs and allowing graphs to be returned from queries; (ii) allowing for more complex patterns (based on regular path queries) to be expressed; and (iii) allowing for different pattern matching semantics – homomorphism, relationship isomorphism (the current default) or node isomorphism – to be configured at a query-by-query level. A subset of the proposed Cypher language extensions has already been implemented on top of Apache Spark. In the tutorial, wewill present our approach including an in-depth analysis of the challenges we faced. This includes mapping the property graph model to the Spark DataFrame abstraction and the translation of Cypher query operators into relational transformations.

fa9645e0491164fe78890073548284604958f383,When Labels Fall Short: Property Graph Simulation via Blending of Network Structure and Vertex Attributes,"Property graphs can be used to represent heterogeneous networks with labeled (attributed) vertices and edges. Given a property graph, simulating another graph with same or greater size with the same statistical properties with respect to the labels and connectivity is critical for privacy preservation and benchmarking purposes. In this work we tackle the problem of capturing the statistical dependence of the edge connectivity on the vertex labels and using the same distribution to regenerate property graphs of the same or expanded size in a scalable manner. However, accurate simulation becomes a challenge when the attributes do not completely explain the network structure. We propose the Property Graph Model (PGM) approach that uses a label augmentation strategy to mitigate the problem and preserve the vertex label and the edge connectivity distributions as well as their correlation, while also replicating the degree distribution.

bc9fde639ceaceafe84c0ad94a2cd7badef141d3,GraphTrek: Asynchronous Graph Traversal for Property Graph-Based Metadata Management,"Property graphs are a promising data model for rich metadata management in high-performance computing (HPC) systems because of their ability to represent not only metadata attributes but also the relationships between them. A property graph can be used to record the relationships between users, jobs, and data, for example, with unique annotations for each entity. This high-volume, power-law distributed use case is a natural fit for an out-of-core distributed property graph database. Such a system must support live updates (to ingest production information in real time), low-latency point queries (for frequent metadata operations such as permission checking), and large-scale traversals (for provenance data mining). Large-scale property graph traversals are particularly challenging for distributed graph databases, however. Most existing graph databases implement a ""level-synchronous"" breadth-first search algorithm that relies on global synchronization in each traversal step. This traversal model performs well in many problem domains, but a rich metadata management system is characterized by imbalanced graphs, long traversal lengths, and concurrent workloads, each of which has the potential to introduce or exacerbate stragglers. We define stragglers as abnormally slow steps (or servers) in a graph traversal that lead to low overall throughput for synchronous traversal algorithms. The straggler problem can be mitigated by the use of asynchronous traversal algorithms. Asynchronous traversal has been successfully demonstrated in graph processing frameworks, but such systems require the graph to be loaded into a separate batch-processing framework. In this work, we propose GraphTrek, a general asynchronous graph traversal engine working with graph databases for processing rich metadata management in their native format. We also outline a traversal-aware query language and key optimizations (traversal-affiliate caching and execution merging) necessary for efficient performance. Our experiments show that the asynchronous graph traversal engine is more efficient than its synchronous counterpart in the case of HPC rich metadata processing, where more servers are involved and larger traversals are needed.",2015,6,2015-09-08,"Graph embeddings, Graph querying, Graph similarity, Graph clustering, Property graph schema, Property Graph",IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing,"1804361,2797656,145311475,145111164,48289026,47557631","Dong Dai,P.

2ced2ac19a88439b52e519d2e6ce44cccf08e191,Motif-based Graph Self-Supervised Learning for Molecular Property Prediction,"Predicting molecular properties with data-driven methods has drawn much attention in recent years. Particularly, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various molecular generation and prediction tasks. In cases where labeled data is scarce, GNNs can be pre-trained on unlabeled molecular data to first learn the general semantic and structural information before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, most existing self-supervised pre-training frameworks for GNNs only focus on node-level or graph-level tasks. These approaches cannot capture the rich information in subgraphs or graph motifs. For example, functional groups (frequently-occurred subgraphs in molecular graphs) often carry indicative information about the molecular properties. To bridge this gap, we propose Motif-based Graph Self-supervised Learning (MGSSL) by introducing a novel self-supervised motif generation framework for GNNs. First, for motif extraction from molecular graphs, we design a molecule fragmentation method that leverages a retrosynthesis-based algorithm BRICS and additional rules for controlling the size of motif vocabulary. Second, we design a general motif-based generative pre-training framework in which GNNs are asked to make topological and label predictions. This generative framework can be implemented in two different ways, i.e., breadth-first or depth-first. Finally, to take the multi-scale information in molecular graphs into consideration, we introduce a multi-level self-supervised pre-training. Extensive experiments on various downstream benchmark tasks show that our methods outperform all state-of-the-art baselines.",2021,8,2021-10-03,"Graph visualization, Graph querying, Graph-based recommendation, Graph modeling, Graph analytics, Property Graph",Neural Information Processing Systems,"2129455190,2144831836,2144219662,46655401,153897134","Zaixin Zhang,Qi Liu,Hao Wang,Chengqiang Lu,Chee-Kong Lee",2129455190,"501b6c76007e700e1b82f34930d24fc04709fc9d,a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84,82181d5c33590a81ab3b773c3948141eb22d89fb,9c96a700a7abff857df936783f9e12a1ab38eee5,47bca586abefde3b796b65c986269f082fcb59c5,db9967871249ffd77adc0c0cc16154ccc37d09ad,b31ce19f12bbf6058f4fe849d9f3654932353f20,a4c5339f3f31c4a4406a1d82d3b0f3c63386166e",21,"2834541,2115294456,80042659"

The existing deep neural network methods usually require large training dataset for each property, impairing their performance in cases (especially for new molecular properties) with a limited amount of experimental data, which are common in real situations. To this end, we propose Meta-MGNN, a novel model for few-shot molecular property prediction. Meta-MGNN applies molecular graph neural network to learn molecular representations and builds a meta-learning framework for model optimization. To exploit unlabeled molecular information and address task heterogeneity of different molecular properties, Meta-MGNN further incorporates molecular structures, attribute based self-supervised modules and self-attentive task weights into the former framework, strengthening the whole learning model.

56092013ab20394725719910fc7d4fe2274f3d54,GPS-Net: Graph Property Sensing Network for Scene Graph Generation,"Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to detect objects in an image along with their pairwise relationships. There are three key properties of scene graph that have been underexplored in recent works: namely, the edge direction information, the difference in priority between nodes, and the long-tailed distribution of relationships. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a Graph Property Sensing Network (GPS-Net) that fully explores these three properties for SGG. First, we propose a novel message passing module that augments the node feature with node-specific contextual information and encodes the edge direction information via a tri-linear model. Second, we introduce a node priority sensitive loss to reflect the difference in priority between nodes during training. This is achieved by designing a mapping function that adjusts the focusing parameter in the focal loss. Third, since the frequency of relationships is affected by the long-tailed distribution problem, we mitigate this issue by first softening the distribution and then enabling it to be adjusted for each subject-object pair according to their visual appearance. Systematic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Moreover, GPS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular databases: VG, OI, and VRD by significant gains under various settings and metrics.

0a3764d605a317c5618a8cc4e83589d87bfff3b9,GeomGCL: Geometric Graph Contrastive Learning for Molecular Property Prediction,"Recently many efforts have been devoted to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to molecular property prediction which is a fundamental task for computational drug and material discovery. One of major obstacles to hinder the successful prediction of molecular property by GNNs is the scarcity of labeled data. Though graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have achieved extraordinary performance with insufficient labeled data, most focused on designing data augmentation schemes for general graphs. However, the fundamental property of a molecule could be altered with the augmentation method (like random perturbation) on molecular graphs. Whereas, the critical geometric information of molecules remains rarely explored under the current GNN and GCL architectures. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method utilizing the geometry of the molecule across 2D and 3D views, which is named GeomGCL. Specifically, we first devise a dual-view geometric message passing network (GeomMPNN) to adaptively leverage the rich information of both 2D and 3D graphs of a molecule. The incorporation of geometric properties at different levels can greatly facilitate the molecular representation learning. Then a novel geometric graph contrastive scheme is designed to make both geometric views collaboratively supervise each other to improve the generalization ability of GeomMPNN.

8b229216a36507730f9911433effab08c700195a,ASGN: An Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction,"Molecular property prediction (e.g., energy) is an essential problem in chemistry and biology. Unfortunately, many supervised learning methods usually suffer from the problem of scarce labeled molecules in the chemical space, where such property labels are generally obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation which is extremely computational costly. An effective solution is to incorporate the unlabeled molecules in a semi-supervised fashion. However, learning semi-supervised representation for large amounts of molecules is challenging, including the joint representation issue of both molecular essence and structure, the conflict between representation and property leaning. Here we propose a novel framework called Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network (ASGN) by incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules. Specifically, ASGN adopts a teacher-student framework. In the teacher model, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method to learn general representation that jointly exploits information from molecular structure and molecular distribution. Then in the student model, we target at property prediction task to deal with the learning loss conflict. At last, we proposed a novel active learning strategy in terms of molecular diversities to select informative data during the whole framework learning. We conduct extensive experiments on several public datasets. Experimental results show the remarkable performance of our ASGN framework.",2020,35,2020-07-06,"Graph partitioning, Graph similarity, Property graph query languages, Graph visualization, Graph mining, Property Graph",Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"2068657088,46655401,1901688087,2359832,3374015,50384136,2227868312,2115294456","Zhong Hao,Chengqiang Lu,Zheyuan Hu,Hongya Wang,Zhenya Huang,Qi Liu,Enhong Chen,Cheekong Lee",2068657088,"b8aecf918f1c729eb2a2fa88da9eb16835daca5a,bfdc1a7d5aab0f4bce4afc9723192937c24ef5ff,5ccd1eefd94af0a20e10a0a5e0da22aa2f481c76,da95d02a50b8208a17127987dde3cdf8da455114,bc9fde639ceaceafe84c0ad94a2cd7badef141d3,d8b65198c37ada92cada81fe315508fc5bdbab8f,501b6c76007e700e1b82f34930d24fc04709fc9d,1f9058eb0b639d0dffae192b3ffd5d80adabf0e9,d9f836a2062864e4808e12224e2286a353498202,07627bf7eb649220ffbcdf6bf233e3a4a76e8590,fa9645e0491164fe78890073548284604958f383,1c2de5fc71be2be3af28545e873605ead4d7d79b,d427db1ba2cc92b36d16a5e5114f1027c90fff68,59f1df2f60280eea79d195b9c561d52a77fb24de,db9967871249ffd77adc0c0cc16154ccc37d09ad,30acd43e62dbbdbe823bcc321ca1a1660ec7a622,44842bba66366522de782f537d9bc61d8868bf08,32c1e0f9ef6f1e337fe4aa2a4907314e5a3f4a5b,9c96a700a7abff857df936783f9e12a1ab38eee5,d71c0365685300539109e0fd07e34c9dd9beff75,cf4068a73d72ced9809a5e2462bb450bbbd47a64,7a62457a9942e45429d4b5d9d8370210df3875ec,4d044f0c84be360b26398b58027e618d5f08a83f,be88a24e9b6e26f10d4d84183c8f05ba33eb60c0,bcad76ae5cea05bad85fd6b2b08aa30a801d9a3b,15748c0437c3be2e464dfb6aa42d2ff5dbd5d7f7,8640a08cdb759d52da026f6d89521e36c61b5910,9acd1892e2e299a30fa99f82bf60fc12cfa7aad3,dba7c73503c4b7abad96aaa4a167fd7e701c4059,873b045dea18c2092b2c11e7b9542dd93ce84d65,7b663c42dd72e2585eed4bf7fc41739e07ce9ff3,30bf7d1694641f6bb3289d980a2326183ad560f0,122a535ae02d4e0fa2512f9c3be77eae6a007266,63dc64fc2d23be98100f4c59e82278d838c78ef9,a4c5339f3f31c4a4406a1d82d3b0f3c63386166e",20,"152290618,2336606,103155734"

This is especially important in the task of molecular graph generation, whose goal is to discover novel molecules with desired properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, while obeying physical laws such as chemical valency. However, designing models to find molecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex and non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional network based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement learning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that incorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can achieve 61% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art baselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184% improvement on the constrained property optimization task.",2018,44,2018-06-07,"Graph representation learning, Graph visualization, Graph pattern matching, Graph neural networks, Property graph schema, Property Graph",Neural Information Processing Systems,"145829303,2156641189,83539859,1806271,1702139","Jiaxuan You,Bowen Liu,Rex Ying,V.

07627bf7eb649220ffbcdf6bf233e3a4a76e8590,Asymmetric Transitivity Preserving Graph Embedding,"Graph embedding algorithms embed a graph into a vector space where the structure and the inherent properties of the graph are preserved. The existing graph embedding methods cannot preserve the asymmetric transitivity well, which is a critical property of directed graphs. Asymmetric transitivity depicts the correlation among directed edges, that is, if there is a directed path from u to v, then there is likely a directed edge from u to v. Asymmetric transitivity can help in capturing structures of graphs and recovering from partially observed graphs. To tackle this challenge, we propose the idea of preserving asymmetric transitivity by approximating high-order proximity which are based on asymmetric transitivity. In particular, we develop a novel graph embedding algorithm, High-Order Proximity preserved Embedding (HOPE for short), which is scalable to preserve high-order proximities of large scale graphs and capable of capturing the asymmetric transitivity. More specifically, we first derive a general formulation that cover multiple popular high-order proximity measurements, then propose a scalable embedding algorithm to approximate the high-order proximity measurements based on their general formulation. Moreover, we provide a theoretical upper bound on the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of the approximation. Our empirical experiments on a synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOPE can approximate the high-order proximities significantly better than the state-of-art algorithms and outperform the state-of-art algorithms in tasks of reconstruction, link prediction and vertex recommendation.",2016,21,2016-08-13,"Graph mining, Graph analytics, Graph modeling, Graph neural networks, Graph pattern matching, Property Graph",Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"1731068,143738684,145525190,48806258,145583986","Mingdong Ou,Peng Cui,J.

While graphs are discrete, most existing methods use continuous latent variables, resulting in inaccurate modeling of discrete graph structures. In this work, we propose GraphDF, a novel discrete latent variable model for molecular graph generation based on normalizing flow methods. GraphDF uses invertible modulo shift transforms to map discrete latent variables to graph nodes and edges.

These graphs arise from various domains, including cybersecurity, social sciences, health sciences, and network sciences, where networks can represent interactions between humans, neurons in the brain, or malicious flows in a network. Exploring these large graphs is crucial for revealing hidden structures and metrics that are not easily computable without parallel computing. Currently, Python users can leverage the open-source Arkouda framework to efficiently execute Pandas and NumPy-related tasks on thousands of cores. To address large-scale graph analysis, Arachne, an extension to Arkouda, enables easy transformation of Arkouda dataframes into graphs. This paper proposes and evaluates three distributable data structures for property graphs, implemented in Chapel, that are integrated into Arachne. Enriching Arachne with support for property graphs will empower data scientists to extend their analysis to new problem domains. Property graphs present additional complexities, requiring efficient storage for extra information on vertices and edges, such as labels, relationships, and properties.",2023,1,2023-09-18,"Graph partitioning, Graph-based recommendation, Graph modeling, Graph algorithms, Graph visualization, Property Graph",IEEE Conference on High Performance Extreme Computing,"2115058093,2242960365,2146997330,1713030","Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez,Fernando Vera Buschmann,Zhihui Du,David A.

1a901533b09269bafa1222ad5f2f5eb0279915ac,Graph Information Bottleneck for Subgraph Recognition,"Given the input graph and its label/property, several key problems of graph learning, such as finding interpretable subgraphs, graph denoising and graph compression, can be attributed to the fundamental problem of recognizing a subgraph of the original one. This subgraph shall be as informative as possible, yet contains less redundant and noisy structure. This problem setting is closely related to the well-known information bottleneck (IB) principle, which, however, has less been studied for the irregular graph data and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a framework of Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) for the subgraph recognition problem in deep graph learning. Under this framework, one can recognize the maximally informative yet compressive subgraph, named IB-subgraph. However, the GIB objective is notoriously hard to optimize, mostly due to the intractability of the mutual information of irregular graph data and the unstable optimization process. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose: i) a GIB objective based-on a mutual information estimator for the irregular graph data; ii) a bi-level optimization scheme to maximize the GIB objective; iii) a connectivity loss to stabilize the optimization process. We evaluate the properties of the IB-subgraph in three application scenarios: improvement of graph classification, graph interpretation and graph denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the information-theoretic IB-subgraph enjoys superior graph properties.",2020,51,2020-10-12,"Graph indexing, Graph similarity, Graph modeling, Graph clustering, Graph visualization, Property Graph",International Conference on Learning Representations,"28822585,1754673,48537464,2419616,1768190,143712929","Junchi Yu,Tingyang Xu,Yu Rong,Yatao Bian,Junzhou Huang,R.

We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments. Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions. We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs, arriving at a modular GCN design, using different propagation rules. Our modular design is capable of distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs, a notoriously difficult problem in network science. Our investigation suggests that, depth is much more influential than width, with deeper GCNs being more capable of learning higher order graph moments. Additionally, combining GCN modules with different propagation rules is critical to the representation power of GCNs.",2019,45,2019-07-11,"Graph representation learning, Graph embeddings, Graph modeling, Graph visualization, Graph-based recommendation, Property Graph",Neural Information Processing Systems,"9716460,1745069,2023052","Nima Dehmamy,A.

5d8b271c412f4be0c689bdfde93916efa0951deb,Molecular Property Prediction: A Multilevel Quantum Interactions Modeling Perspective,"Predicting molecular properties (e.g., atomization energy) is an essential issue in quantum chemistry, which could speed up much research progress, such as drug designing and substance discovery. Traditional studies based on density functional theory (DFT) in physics are proved to be time-consuming for predicting large number of molecules. Recently, the machine learning methods, which consider much rule-based information, have also shown potentials for this issue. However, the complex inherent quantum interactions of molecules are still largely underexplored by existing solutions. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and transferable Multilevel Graph Convolutional neural Network (MGCN) for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we represent each molecule as a graph to preserve its internal structure. Moreover, the well-designed hierarchical graph neural network directly extracts features from the conformation and spatial information followed by the multilevel interactions.

Consequently, the protection of computer systems critically depends on the rigorous identification of vulnerabilities in software, a tedious and error-prone process requiring significant expertise. Unfortunately, a single flaw suffices to undermine the security of a system and thus the sheer amount of code to audit plays into the attacker's cards. In this paper, we present a method to effectively mine large amounts of source code for vulnerabilities. To this end, we introduce a novel representation of source code called a code property graph that merges concepts of classic program analysis, namely abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs and program dependence graphs, into a joint data structure. This comprehensive representation enables us to elegantly model templates for common vulnerabilities with graph traversals that, for instance, can identify buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or memory disclosures. We implement our approach using a popular graph database and demonstrate its efficacy by identifying 18 previously unknown vulnerabilities in the source code of the Linux kernel.",2014,11,2014-05-18,"Graph analytics, Graph mining, Graph database, Graph similarity, Graph-based recommendation, Property Graph",IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,"2944486,2641234,79405068,144825749","Fabian Yamaguchi,N.

In contrast, by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel), which has the property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two graphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels to subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible, we also introduce a randomized projection procedure, similar to the Nystro m method, but for RKHS operators.",2016,17,2016-03-01,"Graph algorithms, Graph modeling, Graph neural networks, Graph visualization, Property graph query languages, Property Graph",Neural Information Processing Systems,"2834541,7823285","R.

b5aea8c6ebaab339b4e190decab80ab607815e8b,Schema Inference for Property Graphs,"Property graph instances are typically populated without defining a schema beforehand. Although this ensures great flexibility, the lack of a schema implies to miss opportunities for query optimization, data integration and analytics, to name a few. Since several graph instances exist prior to the schema definition, extracting the schema from those instances in a principled way might become a significant yet daunting task. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end schema inference method for property graph schemas that tackles complex and nested property values, multi-labeled nodes and node hierarchies. Our method consists of three main steps, the first of which builds upon Cypher queries to extract the node and edge serialization of a property graph. The second step builds over a MapReduce type inference system, working on the serialized output thereby obtained during the first step. The third step analyzes subtypes and supertypes to infer node hierarchies. We describe our schema inference pipeline and its implementation, a labels-and a properties-oriented variant. Finally, we experimentally evaluate and compare the scalability and accuracy of our approaches on several real-life datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to tackle the problem of schema inference for property graphs.",2020,22,2020-09-03,"Graph querying, Graph storage, Graph pattern matching, Graph visualization, Graph representation learning, Property Graph",International Conference on Extending Database Technology,"2005517418,1699192,2058740","Hanâ Lbath,A.

63dc64fc2d23be98100f4c59e82278d838c78ef9,A Representation Learning Framework for Property Graphs,"Representation learning on graphs, also called graph embedding, has demonstrated its significant impact on a series of machine learning applications such as classification, prediction and recommendation. However, existing work has largely ignored the rich information contained in the properties (or attributes) of both nodes and edges of graphs in modern applications, e.g., those represented by property graphs. To date, most existing graph embedding methods either focus on plain graphs with only the graph topology, or consider properties on nodes only. We propose PGE, a graph representation learning framework that incorporates both node and edge properties into the graph embedding procedure. PGE uses node clustering to assign biases to differentiate neighbors of a node and leverages multiple data-driven matrices to aggregate the property information of neighbors sampled based on a biased strategy. PGE adopts the popular inductive model for neighborhood aggregation. We provide detailed analyses on the efficacy of our method and validate the performance of PGE by showing how PGE achieves better embedding results than the state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on benchmark applications such as node classification and link prediction over real-world datasets.",2019,33,2019-07-25,"Graph database, Property graph query languages, Graph querying, Graph indexing, Graph neural networks, Property Graph",Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"2088768581,2108844303,2145413970,1717691,2150427580","Yifan Hou,Hongzhi Chen,Changji Li,James Cheng,Ming Yang",2088768581,"fa9645e0491164fe78890073548284604958f383,dba7c73503c4b7abad96aaa4a167fd7e701c4059,bc9fde639ceaceafe84c0ad94a2cd7badef141d3,be88a24e9b6e26f10d4d84183c8f05ba33eb60c0,82181d5c33590a81ab3b773c3948141eb22d89fb,8640a08cdb759d52da026f6d89521e36c61b5910,b15e942e526e4a03ecd0af31cbdf9b43bf81a829,7ad94b0ec31d38b7915e88f743b573edb8efce5b,d9f836a2062864e4808e12224e2286a353498202,44842bba66366522de782f537d9bc61d8868bf08,a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84,0ff76855604fc150ecd36bc8c3197780a8ea2b23,5d8b271c412f4be0c689bdfde93916efa0951deb,f47def30face829e8034a292c2e3e7a9f4240d34,09430c7080172d50a591cef44d85fd16e58d945e,70f7cd54b5918aed60c3d8c3a8e4aa7e8d634c41,d427db1ba2cc92b36d16a5e5114f1027c90fff68,122a535ae02d4e0fa2512f9c3be77eae6a007266,69381b5efd97e7c55f51c2730caccab3d632d4d2,093e777e08d3a5474e225bbdb1a124d30434d416,30bf7d1694641f6bb3289d980a2326183ad560f0,0fbe5e2f2e2b8e2b2e2f0013e2e07cac2e5ce926,da95d02a50b8208a17127987dde3cdf8da455114,8cfb3412f1bd6025e14f4665c5723ed60a5d8061,b31ce19f12bbf6058f4fe849d9f3654932353f20,07627bf7eb649220ffbcdf6bf233e3a4a76e8590,1c2de5fc71be2be3af28545e873605ead4d7d79b,b8aecf918f1c729eb2a2fa88da9eb16835daca5a,9acd1892e2e299a30fa99f82bf60fc12cfa7aad3,e3b9ffde49c9b4a57b09a651187a2e194cb35693,4d044f0c84be360b26398b58027e618d5f08a83f,bfdc1a7d5aab0f4bce4afc9723192937c24ef5ff,1f9058eb0b639d0dffae192b3ffd5d80adabf0e9",19,"33397943,2158192043,2593963"
8cfb3412f1bd6025e14f4665c5723ed60a5d8061,Graph sample and hold: a framework for big-graph analytics,"Sampling is a standard approach in big-graph analytics; the goal is to efficiently estimate the graph properties by consulting a sample of the whole population. A perfect sample is assumed to mirror every property of the whole population. Unfortunately, such a perfect sample is hard to collect in complex populations such as graphs (e.g. web graphs, social networks), where an underlying network connects the units of the population. Therefore, a good sample will be representative in the sense that graph properties of interest can be estimated with a known degree of accuracy. While previous work focused particularly on sampling schemes to estimate certain graph properties (e.g. triangle count), much less is known for the case when we need to estimate various graph properties with the same sampling scheme. In this paper, we pro- pose a generic stream sampling framework for big-graph analytics, called Graph Sample and Hold (gSH), which samples from massive graphs sequentially in a single pass, one edge at a time, while maintaining a small state in memory. We use a Horvitz-Thompson construction in conjunction with a scheme that samples arriving edges without adjacencies to previously sampled edges with probability p and holds edges with adjacencies with probability q. Our sample and hold framework facilitates the accurate estimation of subgraph patterns by enabling the dependence of the sampling process to vary based on previous history. Within our framework, we show how to produce statistically unbiased estimators for various graph properties from the sample. Given that the graph analytics will run on a sample instead of the whole population, the runtime complexity is kept under control. Moreover, given that the estimators are unbiased, the approximation error is also kept under control. Finally, we test the performance of the proposed framework (gSH) on various types of graphs, showing that from a sample with -- 40K edges, it produces estimates with relative errors < 1%.",2014,10,2014-03-16,"Graph embeddings, Graph algorithms, Graph clustering, Property graph schema, Graph neural networks, Property Graph",Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"47699955,144441300,144050371,2828296","Nesreen Ahmed,N.

b15e942e526e4a03ecd0af31cbdf9b43bf81a829,Deemon: Detecting CSRF with Dynamic Analysis and Property Graphs,"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities are a severe class of web vulnerabilities that have received only marginal attention from the research and security testing communities. While much effort has been spent on countermeasures and detection of XSS and SQLi, to date, the detection of CSRF vulnerabilities is still performed predominantly manually. In this paper, we present Deemon, to the best of our knowledge the first automated security testing framework to discover CSRF vulnerabilities. Our approach is based on a new modeling paradigm which captures multiple aspects of web applications, including execution traces, data flows, and architecture tiers in a unified, comprehensive property graph. We present the paradigm and show how a concrete model can be built automatically using dynamic traces.Then, using graph traversals, we mine for potentially vulnerable operations. Using the information captured in the model, our approach then automatically creates and conducts security tests, to practically validate the found CSRF issues. We evaluate the effectiveness of Deemon with 10 popular open source web applications. Our experiments uncovered 14 previously unknown CSRF vulnerabilities that can be exploited, for instance, to take over user accounts or entire websites.",2017,32,2017-08-29,"Graph modeling, Graph querying, Graph indexing, Graph neural networks, Property graph schema, Property Graph",Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"35030227,1935526,2066454935,144588806,1701081","Giancarlo Pellegrino,Martin Johns,Simon Koch,M.

7b663c42dd72e2585eed4bf7fc41739e07ce9ff3,Grasper: A High Performance Distributed System for OLAP on Property Graphs,"The property graph (PG) model is one of the most general graph data model and has been widely adopted in many graph analytics and processing systems. However, existing systems suffer from poor performance in terms of both latency and throughput for processing online analytical workloads on PGs due to their design defects such as expensive interactions with external databases, low parallelism, and high network overheads. In this paper, we propose Grasper, a high performance distributed system for OLAP on property graphs. Grasper adopts RDMA-aware system designs to reduce the network communication cost. We propose a novel query execution model, called Expert Model, which supports adaptive parallelism control at the fine-grained query operation level and allows tailored optimizations for different categories of query operators, thus achieving high parallelism and good load balancing. Experimental results show that Grasper achieves low latency and high throughput on a broad range of online analytical workloads.",2019,14,2019-11-20,"Graph modeling, Graph database, Property graph schema, Graph representation learning, Graph analytics, Property Graph",ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,"2108844303,2145413970,2115219530,2150609388,1717691,2151811827,2088768581,145837716","Hongzhi Chen,Changji Li,Juncheng Fang,Chenghuan Huang,James Cheng,Jian Zhang,Yifan Hou,Xiao Yan",2108844303,"a91e67f6b72a3bb9b5f0f054a252c8ee0cbfd898,91d6e8ba5dd90b02fe3bd870b19da13a6167af53,63dc64fc2d23be98100f4c59e82278d838c78ef9,7c70459d56214a7a3202732670f5ce726508eff6,d9f836a2062864e4808e12224e2286a353498202,d71c0365685300539109e0fd07e34c9dd9beff75,1f9058eb0b639d0dffae192b3ffd5d80adabf0e9,fa9645e0491164fe78890073548284604958f383,b31ce19f12bbf6058f4fe849d9f3654932353f20,9acd1892e2e299a30fa99f82bf60fc12cfa7aad3,5ccd1eefd94af0a20e10a0a5e0da22aa2f481c76,61aec24ce3ce839bf08ce98e061099f2a20a50d6,70f7cd54b5918aed60c3d8c3a8e4aa7e8d634c41,8640a08cdb759d52da026f6d89521e36c61b5910",19,"49500220,144270731,153699425"
0fbe5e2f2e2b8e2b2e2f0013e2e07cac2e5ce926,Every monotone graph property is testable,"A graph property is called monotone if it is closed under taking (not necessarily induced) subgraphs (or, equivalently, if it is closed under removal of edges and vertices). Many monotone graph properties are some of the most well-studied properties in graph theory, and the abstract family of all monotone graph properties was also extensively studied. Our main result in this paper is that any monotone graph property can be tested with one-sided error, and with query complexity depending only on ε. This result unifies several previous results in the area of property testing, and also implies the testability of well-studied graph properties that were previously not known to be testable. At the heart of the proof is an application of a variant of Szemerédi's Regularity Lemma. The main ideas behind this application may be useful in characterizing all testable graph properties, and in generally studying graph property testing.As a byproduct of our techniques we also obtain additional results in graph theory and property testing, which are of independent interest. One of these results is that the query complexity of testing testable graph properties with one-sided error may be arbitrarily large. Another result, which significantly extends previous results in extremal graph-theory, is that for any monotone graph property P, any graph that is ε -far from satisfying P, contains a subgraph of size depending on ε only, which does not satisfy P. Finally, we prove the following compactness statement: If a graph G is ε-far from satisfying a (possibly infinite) set of graph properties P, then it is at least δ P ε-far from satisfying one of the properties.",2005,6,2005-05-22,"Graph pattern matching, Graph modeling, Graph mining, Graph indexing, Graph storage, Property Graph",Symposium on the Theory of Computing,"1734327,4490562","N.
