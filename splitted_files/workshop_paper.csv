91d6e8ba5dd90b02fe3bd870b19da13a6167af53,The Property Graph Database Model,"Most of the current graph database systems have been designed to support property graphs. Surprisingly, there is no standard specification of the database model behind such systems. This paper presents a formal definition of the property graph database model. Specifically, we define the property graph data structure, basic notions of integrity constraints (e.g. graph schema), and a graph query language.",2018,121,,"Graph indexing, Graph visualization, Graph embeddings, Graph analytics, Graph clustering, Property Graph",Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management,2772109,Renzo Angles,2772109,,,"31846192,144588806,31359282"
