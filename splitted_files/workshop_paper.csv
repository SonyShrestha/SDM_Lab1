91d6e8ba5dd90b02fe3bd870b19da13a6167af53,The Property Graph Database Model,"Most of the current graph database systems have been designed to support property graphs. Surprisingly, there is no standard specification of the database model behind such systems. This paper presents a formal definition of the property graph database model. Specifically, we define the property graph data structure, basic notions of integrity constraints (e.g. graph schema), and a graph query language.",2018,121,,"Graph indexing, Graph visualization, Graph embeddings, Graph analytics, Graph clustering, Property Graph",Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management,2772109,Renzo Angles,2772109,,18,"2285406,2118167859,145301017"
bcad76ae5cea05bad85fd6b2b08aa30a801d9a3b,PGQL: a property graph query language,"Graph-based approaches to data analysis have become more widespread, which has given need for a query language for graphs. Such a graph query language needs not only SQL-like functionality for querying structured data, but also intrinsic support for typical graph-style applications: reachability analysis, path finding and graph construction.  We propose a new query language for the popular Property Graph (PG) data model: the Property Graph Query Language (PGQL). PGQL is based on the paradigm of graph pattern matching, closely follows syntactic structures of SQL, and provides regular path queries with conditions on labels and properties to allow for reachability and path finding queries. Besides intrinsic vertex, edge and path types, PGQL also has the graph as intrinsic type and allows for graph construction and query composition.",2016,139,2016-06-24,"Graph representation learning, Graph clustering, Graph indexing, Graph neural networks, Graph algorithms, Property Graph",International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences and Systems,"3159707,2207212,1681148,2115698286,1694512","O.

122a535ae02d4e0fa2512f9c3be77eae6a007266,RDF and Property Graphs Interoperability: Status and Issues,"RDF and Property Graph databases are two approaches for data management that are based on modeling, storing and querying graph-like data. In this paper, we present a short study about the interoperability between these approaches. We review the current solutions to the problem, identify their features, and discuss the inherent issues.",2019,40,,"Graph embeddings, Graph analytics, Graph modeling, Graph querying, Property graph schema, Property Graph",Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management,"2772109,144245703,1777646","Renzo Angles,Harsh Thakkar,Dominik Tomaszuk",2772109,,19,"1802648,47464238,153699425"

However, many contemporary analytical tasks are performed on graphs. Property graphs are currently one of the most prevalent data models for graph data management in industry. Therefore, a key challenge is to understand the fundamental relationships between relational databases and property graph databases. This paper reports our ongoing work towards understanding these relationships by proposing R2PG-DM, a direct mapping of relational databases to property graphs. Given a relational database schema and instance, a direct mapping generates a corresponding property graph instance. The semantics of our mapping is defined using Datalog. Our work is inspired by existing approaches for direct mappings of relational databases into earlier graph data models. Future work is to study our mapping with respect to fundamental properties such as information and query preservation.",2019,10,,"Graph storage, Graph embeddings, Graph database, Graph modeling, Graph indexing, Property Graph",Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management,"145881292,145301017,1703204","R.
